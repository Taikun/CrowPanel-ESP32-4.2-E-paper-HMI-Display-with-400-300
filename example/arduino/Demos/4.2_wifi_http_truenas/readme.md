# TrueNAS Demo

This demo queries a TrueNAS server using its REST API and cycles through three
different screens on the e-paper display:

1. Pool status with usage bars
2. Active alerts
3. System information (CPU load, RAM usage and uptime)

Configure the server URL and API key in `secrets.h` before uploading the sketch.
